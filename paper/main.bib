   abstract = {<p>The potential for carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to independently constrain both the formation temperature of carbonate minerals and fluid oxygen isotope composition allows insight into long‐standing questions in the Earth sciences, but remaining discrepancies between calibration schemes hamper interpretation of temperature measurements. To address discrepancies between calibrations, we designed and analyzed a sample suite (41 total samples) with broad applicability across the geosciences, with an exceptionally wide range of formation temperatures, precipitation methods, and mineralogies. We see no statistically significant offset between sample types, although the comparison of calcite and dolomite remains inconclusive. When data are reduced identically, the regression defined by this study is nearly identical to that defined by four previous calibration studies that used carbonate‐based standardization; we combine these data to present a composite carbonate‐standardized regression equation. Agreement across a wide range of temperature and sample types demonstrates a unified, broadly applicable clumped isotope thermometer calibration.</p>},

   abstract = {Accurate constraints on past ocean temperatures and compositions are critical for documenting climate change and resolving its causes. Most proxies for temperature are not thermodynamically based, appear to be subject to biological processes, require regional calibrations, and/or are influenced by fluid composition. As a result, their interpretation becomes uncertain when they are applied in settings not necessarily resembling those in which they were empirically calibrated. Independent proxies for past temperature could provide an important means of testing and/or expanding on existing reconstructions. Here we report measurements of abundances of stable isotopologues of calcitic and aragonitic benthic and planktic foraminifera and coccoliths, relate those abundances to independently estimated growth temperatures, and discuss the possible scope of equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects. The proportions of 13C-18O bonds in these samples exhibits a temperature dependence that is generally similar to that previously been reported for inorganic calcite and other biologically precipitated carbonate-containing minerals (apatite from fish, reptile, and mammal teeth; calcitic brachiopods and molluscs; aragonitic coral and mollusks). Most species that exhibit non-equilibrium 18O/16O (δ18O) and 13C/12C (δ13C) ratios are characterized by 13C-18O bond abundances that are similar to inorganic calcite and are generally indistinguishable from apparent equilibrium, with possible exceptions among benthic foraminiferal samples from the Arctic Ocean where temperatures are near-freezing. Observed isotope ratios in biogenic carbonates can be explained if carbonate minerals generally preserve a state of ordering that reflects the extent of isotopic equilibration of the dissolved inorganic carbon species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Schauer2016,
   abstract = {Rationale: The clumped isotope composition of CO2 (Δ47) derived from carbonate is widely used as a paleotemperature proxy with broad applications in geoscience. Its accuracy is, however, limited by inter-laboratory discrepancies of reference materials and disagreement among carbonate geothermometer calibrations. Here we show how the correction for the abundance of 17O influences these discrepancies. Methods: We used CO2-H2O equilibration at known temperatures and phosphoric acid digested carbonates to generate CO2 samples with a wide range in 13C and 18O compositions. All samples were purified using an offline vacuum line. We used a Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Faraday collector array for m/z 44–49, to measure δ13C, δ18O, δ47, and Δ47 values. Data were compiled using a traditional correction (‘Santrock’) for the 17O interference in m/z 45 as well as a more recently proposed correction (‘Brand’) for 17O interference. Two reference frames using CO2 with distinct 13C compositions were constructed to simulate an inter-laboratory comparison. Results: The traditional Santrock 17O correction leads to a simulated Δ47 inter-laboratory comparison offset of 0.06 ‰, and a 0.1 ‰ Δ47 range in CO2-H2O 23°C equilibrations that is dependent on the 13C composition. The more recent Brand 17O correction removes these discrepancies. The traditional 17O correction yields distinct temperature-Δ47 calibration curves for synthetic carbonates precipitated using different methods to degas CO2, while the more recent 17O correction collapses all calibration data onto a single curve. Conclusions: The 17O correction strategy employed by CO2 and carbonate clumped-isotope researchers can have a large effect on the accuracy of Δ47 values. Use of the traditional 17O correction may have caused errors in published studies as large as 0.1 ‰ and may account for Δ47 differences among laboratories and disagreement among previously published carbonate clumped isotope thermometry calibrations.

   abstract = {The clumped isotopic composition of carbonate-derived CO2 (denoted Δ47) is a function of carbonate formation temperature and in natural samples can act as a recorder of paleoclimate, burial, or diagenetic conditions. The absolute abundance of heavy isotopes in the universal standards VPDB and VSMOW (defined by four parameters: R13VPDB, R17VSMOW, R18VSMOW, and λ) impact calculated Δ47 values. Here, we investigate whether use of updated and more accurate values for these parameters can remove observed interlaboratory differences in the measured T-Δ47 relationship. Using the updated parameters, we reprocess 14 published calibration data sets measured in 11 different laboratories, representing many mineralogies, bulk compositions, sample types, reaction temperatures, and sample preparation and analysis methods. Exploiting this large composite data set (n = 1,253 sample replicates), we investigate the possibility for a “universal” clumped isotope calibration. We find that applying updated parameters improves the T-Δ47 relationship (reduces residuals) within most labs and improves overall agreement but does not eliminate all interlaboratory differences. We reaffirm earlier findings that different mineralogies do not require different calibration equations and that cleaning procedures, method of pressure baseline correction, and mass spectrometer type do not affect interlaboratory agreement. We also present new estimates of the temperature dependence of the acid digestion fractionation for Δ47 (Δ*25-X), based on combining reprocessed data from four studies, and new theoretical equilibrium values to be used in calculation of the empirical transfer function. Overall, we have ruled out a number of possible causes of interlaboratory disagreement in the T-Δ47 relationship, but many more remain to be investigated.},

@article{Bonifacie_2017,
   abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is based on the temperature-dependent formation of 13C18O16O22− ion groups within the lattice of solid carbonate minerals. At low temperatures the bonds between rare, heavy 13C and 18O isotopes are thermodynamically favored, and thus at equilibrium they are present in higher than random abundances. Here we calibrate the use of this temperature proxy in a previously uncalibrated carbonate phase — dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] — over a temperature range that extends to conditions typical of shallow crustal environments, by determining the Δ47 values of CO2 extracted from synthetic or natural (proto)dolomites grown at known temperatures from 25 to 350 °C and analyzed in two different laboratories using different procedures for sample analysis, purification and post-measurement data treatment. We found that the Δ47-1/T2 dependence for (proto)dolomite is linear between 25 and 350 °C, independent of their Mg/Ca compositions or cation order (or the laboratory in which they were analyzed), and offset from, but parallel to, the theoretical predictions of the Δ63 dependence to temperature of the abundance of the 13C18O16O2 isotopologue inside the dolomite and calcite mineral lattices as expected from ab-initio calculations (Schauble et al., 2006). This suggests that neither the equilibrium constant for 13C–18O clumping in (proto)dolomite lattice, nor the experimental fractionation associated with acid digestion to produce CO2, depend on their formation mechanism, degree of cation order and/or stoichiometry (i.e., Mg/Ca ratio) and/or δ18O and δ13C compositions (at least over the range we explored). Thus, we suggest the following single Δ47-1/T2 linear regression for describing all dolomite minerals: Δ47CDES90=0.0428(±0.0033)∗106/T2+0.1174(±0.0248)(r2=0.997),with T in kelvin and Δ47 in the Carbon Dioxide Equilibrium Scale (CDES) of Dennis et al. (2011) and referring to CO2 extracted by phosphoric acid digestion at 90 °C. The listed uncertainties on slope and intercept are 95% confidence intervals. The temperature sensitivity (slope) of this relation is lower than those based on low temperature acid digestion of carbonates, but comparable to most of those based on high temperature acid digestion (with however significantly better constraints on the slope and intercept values, notably due to the large range in temperature investigated here and the large number of Δ47 measurements performed, n = 67). We also use this dataset to empirically determine that the acid fractionation factor associated with phosphoric acid digestion of dolomite at 90 °C (Δ*dolomite90) is about +0.176‰. This is comparable to the Δ*calcite90 experimentally obtained for calcite (Guo et al., 2009), suggesting that the acid fractionation Δ* for acid digestion of dolomite and calcite are the same within error of measurement, with apparently no influence of the cation identity. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that our dolomite calibration data are indistinguishable from published calibration data for calcite, aragonite and siderite generated in similar analytical conditions (i.e., carbonate digested at T ⩾ 70 °C and directly referenced into CDES), demonstrating excellent consistency among the four (Ca, Mg, Fe)CO3 mineral phases analyzed in seven different laboratories (this represents a total of 103 mean Δ47 values resulting from more than 331 Δ47 measurements). These data are used to calculate a robust composite Δ47-T universal relation for those carbonate minerals of geological interest, for temperatures between −1 and 300 °C (that is statistically indistinguishable from the one described by dolomite only): Δ47CDES90=0.0422(±0.0019)∗106/T2+0.1262(±0.0207)(r2=0.985)Thus, in order to standardize the temperature estimates out of different laboratories running high temperature digestion of (Ca, Mg, Fe)CO3 carbonate minerals, we recommend the use of this single Δ47-T calibration to convert Δ47CDES data into accurate and precise temperature estimates. More widely, this study extends the use of the Δ47 thermometry to studies of diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism of carbonates with unprecedented precision on temperature estimates based on Δ47 measurements — environments where many other thermometers are generally empirical or semi-quantitative.},

Calculations rely on density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) with norm-conserving planewave pseudopotentials to determine the vibrational frequencies of isotopically substituted crystals. Our results predict an ∼0.4‰ excess of multiscripts(13 C 18 O 16 O, 2, mml:none(), mml:none(), 2 -) groups in all studied carbonate minerals at room-temperature equilibrium, relative to what would be expected in a stochastic mixture of carbonate isotopologues with the same bulk 13C/12C, 18O/16O, and 17O/16O ratios. The amount of excess multiscripts(13 C 18 O 16 O, 2, mml:none(), mml:none(), 2 -) decreases with increasing temperature of equilibration, from 0.5‰ at 0 °C to <0.1‰ at 300 °C, suggesting that measurements of multiply substituted isotopologues of carbonate could be used to infer temperatures of ancient carbonate mineral precipitation and alteration events, even where the δ18O of coexisting fluids is uncertain. The predicted temperature sensitivity of the equilibrium constant is ∼0.003‰/°C at 25 °C. Estimated equilibrium constants for the formation of multiscripts(13 C 18 O 16 O, 2, mml:none(), mml:none(), 2 -) are remarkably uniform for the variety of minerals studied, suggesting that temperature calibrations will also be applicable to carbonate minerals not studied here without greatly compromising accuracy. A related equilibrium constant for the reaction:\{A formula is presented\}in calcite indicates formation of 0.1‰ excess 12C18O17O16O2- at 25 °C. In a conventional phosphoric acid reaction of carbonate to form CO2 for mass-spectrometric analysis, molecules derived from multiscripts(13 C 18 O 16 O, 2, mml:none(), mml:none(), 2 -) dominate (∼96%) the mass 47 signal, and 12C18O17O16O2- contributes most of the remainder (3%). This suggests that carbonate internal equilibration temperatures can be recovered from acid-generated CO2 if abundances of isotopologues with mass 44-47 can be measured to sufficient precision. We have also calculated 18O/16O and 13C/12C reduced partition function ratios for carbonate minerals, and find them to be in good agreement with experiments and empirical calibrations. Carbon and oxygen isotope fractionation factors in hypothetical 40Mg-magnesite and 40Ba-witherite indicate that M2+-cation mass does not contribute significantly to equilibrium isotopic fractionations between carbonate minerals. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP) forms the western portion of the Turkish-Iranian plateau and has mostly remained above sea level since ca. 41 Ma. However, the current topography of the CAP has predominantly developed since the Late Miocene, with mean elevations of ca. 1.0–1.5 km and northern and southern mountainous margins with peak elevations that locally exceed 3 km. To clarify patterns of surface uplift, we present paleoelevation estimates for the past 10 Ma by applying stable isotope paleoaltimetry on soil carbonates from the CAP and nearby coastal regions, as well as dual clumped isotope paleothermometry. The compiled datasets from the Aegean-Anatolian region display a sustained increase in δ18O values of soil carbonates after the Miocene, in response to increased regional aridification. Our paleoaltimetry and dual clumped isotope results indicate that the CAP has been at higher elevations than the modern coastal regions since 10 Ma. By ca. 8 − 6 Ma, our refined paleoaltimetry estimates indicate the presence of a ca. 1.5 km-high orographic barrier. However, surface uplift of the Tauride and Pontide mountains on the southern and northern plateau margin postdate surface uplift of the CAP. Therefore, surface uplift of the CAP and its mountainous margins were decoupled during the Late Miocene, implying distinct geodynamic drivers for their asynchronous formation. Given that the Tauride Mts. emerged from the Mediterranean after 7 Ma, we document outward growth of the southern plateau margin since the Late Miocene.},

   abstract = {The Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 records abrupt transitions from cold stadial to temperate interstadial climate conditions, termed Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. Reconstructing these rapid climate changes is crucial for documenting the prevailing climatic conditions in Europe during the extinction of the Neanderthals. However, only few continental records are available to define the continental climatic responses to DO changes. Here, the elemental and stable isotope compositions of a well-dated speleothem in Belgium covering the MIS 3 are documented. This speleothem precipitated under equilibrium conditions based on Δ48 thermometry, allowing the use of Δ47 thermometry with confidence. Moreover, the precision and accuracy of our clumped-isotope analyses are demonstrated through the long-term monitoring of international Δ47 standards. The acquired unique thermometry paleoclimatic dataset enables the reconstruction of temperature based on the hydrological information (oxygen-18 of drip water; δ18Ow) and sheds new light on the DO climate variations. A temperature differential of ∼7 °C is associated with alternating temperate warm and wet Interstadials to cold and dry stadials. The DO-12 is the most pronounced MIS 3 interstadial in the record and appears to be marked by a delay of 1000 years between climate enhancement (warmer temperature) and water availability (moisture increase). By combining our speleothem record with other continental and marine archive, the spatial variability of DO changes in Europe during the MIS 3 is defined. A gradual climate deterioration with colder and drier conditions, associated with the Heinrich 4 event, progressed southwards through Europe. This spatial climatic degradation, during the last phase of Neanderthal populations occupation in Europe, provides better environmental constraints for human mobility models.},

   abstract = { Temperature proxies such as clumped isotope (Δ 47 ) thermometry on biogenic carbonates are applied to the past with greatest confidence when the proxy‐temperature relationship is shown to be robust within natural temperature conditions of the ocean. Especially well‐suited for this purpose are biogenic carbonates sampled from well‐constrained production period and oceanographic conditions of sediment traps. Since coccolithophorids have a cosmopolitan distribution and are major biogenic carbonate producers in the surface ocean, their coccoliths usually dominate the inorganic carbon flux in sediment traps and are sufficiently abundant in most traps for clumped isotope analysis. Here, we measured Δ 47 in the coccolith size fraction of 18 sediment trap samples across a 75° latitudinal gradient and three ocean basins. To identify the upper ocean provenance region of the coccoliths in each trap, a simple model of coccolith transport by ocean currents was constructed. The coccolith Δ 47 strongly follows upper ocean temperatures, and there is no evidence for a coccolithophore species‐specific effect on the Δ 47 ‐temperature relationship. Applying the coccolith‐specific Δ 47 ‐temperature calibration (Clark, Torres‐Romero, et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp‐20‐2081‐2024 ) to estimate calcification temperatures shows that inferred calcification depths match the depth of maximum coccolithophore production, and shows a good agreement with the depth of maximum coccolithophore abundance and the expected depth of coccolith production. We also measured dual clumped isotopes (Δ 47 and Δ 48 ) on coccoliths cultured under controlled temperatures, and confirm that the coccolith clumped isotopes are affected by kinetic bias, independently verifying the need for a coccolith‐specific calibration for accurate paleotemperature reconstructions by means of Δ 47 . },

   abstract = {Molluscan shell-carbonates are extensively used to reconstruct paleo-temperatures at sub-annual resolution. The accurate application of two widely used temperature proxies, the shell carbonate oxygen isotope (ẟ18O) and carbonate clumped isotope (Δ47) composition, is based on the assumption that kinetics in the DIC-H2O-CaCO3 system were either absent or invariant during shell formation and/or can be corrected for via empirical calibration. Here, we analysed the dual clumped isotope composition, i.e., ∆47 and ∆48, of a wide range of modern and Eocene molluscs (bivalves and gastropods) to investigate the potential importance of kinetics during molluscan biomineralisation. We show that Δ47 and Δ48 of most of our modern samples are indistinguishable from equilibrium. For these samples, ∆47-derived temperatures conform to corresponding growth temperatures within their fully propagated 95% uncertainties of ≤ +/-2.3°C. Significant departures from equilibrium values are only obtained for two samples characterised by growth temperatures &lt;10°C. Together, these results strongly imply that bivalve and gastropod shell carbonates represent key archives for accurate and highly precise reconstructions of sea surface temperatures by means of ∆47 clumped isotope thermometry. Kinetic limitations of this thermometer may only become important at relatively low temperatures. ∆ -derived temperatures for our Eocene samples (~39 Ma) from the Hampshire Basin (paleo-latitude ~40°N)) show a range of 17.3-23.2°C. These paleo-temperatures are in good agreement with previous sea surface temperatures for the mid-Eocene mid latitude regions based on foraminifera clumped isotopes, adding confidence to both datasets. In addition, in order to aid the accurate reconstruction of seawater ẟ18O values, we compiled published oxygen isotope fractionation data for molluscs and established relationships that describe the temperature dependence of oxygen isotope fractionation between water and molluscan calcite and aragonite, respectively. Applying the equation for aragonite to the Eocene samples, we obtain reconstructed seawater δ18O for the Hampshire Basin between -2.3‰ and - 3.5‰ VSMOW.},

   abstract = {Giant clams (Tridacna) are well-suited archives for studying past climates at (sub-)seasonal timescales, even in ‘deep-time’ due to their high preservation potential. They are fast growing (mm-cm/year), live several decades and build large aragonitic shells with seasonal to daily growth increments. Here we present a multi-proxy record of a late Miocene Tridacna that grew on the western margin of the Makassar Strait (Indonesia). By analysing daily elemental cycle lengths using our recently developed Python script Daydacna, we build an internal age model, which indicates that our record spans 20,916 ± 1220 days (2 SD), i.e. ∼57 ± 3 years. Our temporally resolved dataset of elemental ratios (El/Ca at sub-daily resolution) and stable oxygen and carbon isotopes (δ18O and δ13C at seasonal to weekly resolution) was complemented by dual clumped isotope measurements, which reveal that the shell grew in isotopic equilibrium with seawater. The corresponding Δ47 value yields a temperature of 27.9 ± 2.4 °C (2 SE) from which we calculate a mean oxygen isotopic composition of late Miocene tropical seawater of −0.43 ± 0.50 ‰. In our multi-decadal high temporal resolution records, we found multi-annual, seasonal and daily cycles as well as multi-day extreme weather events. We hypothesise that the multi-annual cycles (slightly above three years) might reflect global climate phenomena like ENSO, with the more clearly preserved yearly cycles indicating regional changes of water inflow into the reef, which together impact the local isotopic composition of water, temperature and nutrient availability. In addition, our chronology indicates that twice a year a rainy and cloudy season, presumably related to the passing of the ITCZ, affected light availability and primary productivity in the reef, reflected in decreased shell growth rates.

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. During the Middle Miocene, the Earth shifted from a warm state, the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; 16.9–14.7 Ma), to a colder state associated with the formation of extensive and permanent ice sheets on Antarctica. This climatic shift, the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition (MMCT; 14.7–13.8 Ma) strongly affected the composition and structure of major biomes, ocean circulation, and precipitation patterns. Although Middle Miocene climate dynamics are well documented in marine records, our knowledge of terrestrial climate change is not well constrained. Here we present a long-term (23–13 Ma) stable (δ13C, δ18O) and clumped (Δ47) isotope record of soil carbonates from a northern Mediterranean Alpine foreland basin: the Digne–Valensole basin (DVB), France. Δ47-derived soil carbonate formation temperatures indicate a highly dynamic dry season temperature pattern that is consistent with multiple periods of reorganization of atmospheric circulation during the MCO. We propose that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns modified the seasonality of precipitation and, ultimately, the timing of pedogenic carbonate formation. Consequently, Δ47 soil carbonate temperature data record the combined effects of long-term regional temperature and carbonate formation seasonality change. The data are consistent with the existence of a proto-Mediterranean climate already during certain MCO time intervals. Following the MMCT, the stable and clumped isotope record displays pronounced cooling after 13.8 Ma accompanied by a rather large (−5.0 %) decrease in soil water δ18O values. Our northern Mediterranean foreland basin climate record shares strong similarities with time-equivalent records from the terrestrial European mid-latitudes and the global oceans and enhances our understanding of the circum-Alpine Middle Miocene terrestrial climate dynamics.</p>},

   abstract = {RATIONALE The measurement of the abundances of minor isotopologues by mass spectrometry requires correction of subtle non-linearities in the mass spectrometer that cause deviations in the relationship between actual and measured isotope ratios. Here we show that negative backgrounds on the Faraday cups recording the minor ion beams are the cause of the observed non-linearities in the measurement of CO2 isotopologues, and propose a new correction procedure for clumped isotope measurements. METHODS We carefully investigated the cause of non-linearity effects in the measurement of the abundance of 13C18O16O, a minor isotopologue of CO2 with m/z 47, on two different mass spectrometers. By using gases of different composition with close to stochastic and with non-random distribution of isotopes we demonstrate that the apparent dependence of the excess abundance of the isotopologue of m/z 47 on the bulk isotopic composition of CO2 is due to a background interference that is linearly dependent on the partial pressure of the gas in the source of the mass spectrometer. CONCLUSIONS Background determination with gas flowing into the source of the mass spectrometer is necessary for accurate clumped isotope measurements of CO2. Background corrections can be performed accurately if the slit width of the m/z 44 Faraday cup significantly exceeds that of the one for m/z 47, using a correlation between m/z 44 signal intensity and the corresponding minimum in m/z 47 background. We propose two new correction schemes that reduce the time-consuming measurement of gases of different bulk isotopic compositions. These findings may also be relevant for the measurement of other rare isotopologues by mass spectrometry. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry is based upon the principle that the formation temperature of carbonates is proportional to the relative abundance of 13C18O16O in CO2 produced through carbonate acid digestion. Furthermore, the relative abundance of 13C18O16O is independent of the δ18O value of parent water, providing a viable alternative to the classic oxygen isotope carbonate-water paleothermometer. The temperature resolution of this newly developed paleothermometer primarily relies on the analytical techniques required to determine the clumped isotope composition of a carbonate mineral. These analytical techniques involve: (1) CO2 gas evolution, in which carbonate is reacted with phosphoric acid, yielding CO2 with a clumped isotope composition proportional to the carbonate formation temperature; (2) CO2 purification, in which a rigorous purification of acid-liberated CO2 is achieved by removing contaminants; (3) clumped isotope measurement, in which a customized gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometer quantifies the raw clumped isotope composition (Δ47) of the purified CO2 gas; and (4) inter-laboratory standardization, in which raw Δ47 values are normalized with respect to a community-accepted reference frame. This review provides an overview and comparison of the analytical techniques currently utilized in stable isotope laboratories for Δ47 measurements, specifically discussing carbonate pre-treatment techniques, phosphoric acid digestion systems, isotope and temperature effects during carbonate phosphoric acid digestion, CO2 purification processes, and the challenges associated with the measurement and standardization of the Δ47 value. Continued refinement of these analytical techniques will aid in reducing sample size, increasing sample throughput, and improving Δ47 external precision and associated paleotemperature resolution. Furthermore, these advances may assist in elucidating the source of discrepancies in slope between two groups of reported carbonate clumped isotope thermometer calibrations.},

   abstract = {It is well known that a subtle nonlinearity can occur during clumped isotope analysis of CO2 that – if remaining unaddressed – limits accuracy. The nonlinearity is induced by a negative background on the m/z 47 ion Faraday cup, whose magnitude is correlated with the intensity of the m/z 44 ion beam. The origin of the negative background remains unclear, but is possibly due to secondary electrons. Usually, CO2 gases of distinct bulk isotopic compositions are equilibrated at 1000 °C and measured along with the samples in order to be able to correct for this effect. Alternatively, measured m/z 47 beam intensities can be corrected for the contribution of secondary electrons after monitoring how the negative background on m/z 47 evolves with the intensity of the m/z 44 ion beam. The latter correction procedure seems to work well if the m/z 44 cup exhibits a wider slit width than the m/z 47 cup. Here we show that the negative m/z 47 background affects precision of dual inlet-based clumped isotope measurements of CO2 unless raw m/z 47 intensities are directly corrected for the contribution of secondary electrons. Moreover, inaccurate results can be obtained even if the heated gas approach is used to correct for the observed nonlinearity. The impact of the negative background on accuracy and precision arises from small imbalances in m/z 44 ion beam intensities between reference and sample CO2 measurements. It becomes the more significant the larger the relative contribution of secondary electrons to the m/z 47 signal is and the higher the flux rate of CO2 into the ion source is set. These problems can be overcome by correcting the measured m/z 47 ion beam intensities of sample and reference gas for the contributions deriving from secondary electrons after scaling these contributions to the intensities of the corresponding m/z 49 ion beams. Accuracy and precision of this correction are demonstrated by clumped isotope analysis of three internal carbonate standards. The proposed correction scheme can be easily applied if the slit width of the m/z 49 Faraday cup is bigger than that of the m/z 47 cup.},

   abstract = {Clumped-isotope measurements in CO2 and carbonates (Δ47) present a number of technical challenges and require correcting for various sources of analytical nonlinearity. For now, we lack a formal description of the analytical errors associated with these correction steps, which are not accounted for in most data processing methods currently in use. Here we formulate a quantitative description of Δ47 error propagation, fully taking into account standardization errors and their properties. We find that standardization errors are highly sensitive to the isotopic compositions (δ47, Δ47) of unknown samples relative to the standards used for analytical corrections, and in many cases constitute a non-negligible source of uncertainty, causing true measurements errors to exceed traditionally reported error estimates by a factor of 1.5 (typically) to 3.5 (in extreme cases). Using Monte Carlo simulations based on the full InterCarb data set, we find that this model yields accurate error estimates in spite of small non-Gaussian effects which remain entirely negligible in practice. We also describe various standardization strategies, along with the assumptions they rely on, in the context of this model, and propose a new, “pooled” standardization approach designed to yield more robust/accurate corrections. Among other uses, the mathematical framework described here may be helpful to improve standardization protocols (e.g., anchor/unknown ratios) and inform future efforts to define community reference materials. What is more, these models imply that the inter-laboratory scatter (N = 5,329) observed in the InterCarb exercise (Bernasconi, Daëron, et al., 2021) can be entirely explained as the effects of current standardization procedures. Based on these findings, we recommend that future studies systematically report full analytical uncertainties taking standardization errors into account. In line with this recommendation, we provide user-friendly online resources and an open-source Python library designed to facilitate the use of these error models.},

However, none of the commonly-used flavors of least-squares regression, such as York regression or Generalized Least Squares (GLS), take into account the full set of covariances between all observed (x, y) values. Here we describe the Omnivariant Generalized Least Squares (OGLS) method to fit a model of the form y = f(x), accounting for the full error correlation structure of the (x, y) data, based on a first-order linear propagation of the uncertainties in all variables into errors in y residuals, followed by minimizing the vector of y residuals with respect to the Mahalanobis norm defined by its covariance matrix. This approach may be described as a generalization of both York regression and GLS. It is mathematically exact for straight-line fits, and is also suitable for many non-linear models. Here we describe the principles of OGLS regression and discuss its properties, caveats, and practical use, and provide two consistent open-source implementations in Python and R. To illustrate how various fields of geochronology and stable-isotope geochemistry may benefit from this new method, we discuss how OGLS may specifically apply to 40Ar/39Ar dating and how it provides robust mathematical evidence that Δ47 carbonate calibrations in the recently defined I-CDES metrological scale are statistically indistinguishable, effectively solving long-standing methodological discrepancies.},

Atmospheric gases also have isotopologues containing two or more rare isotopes (e.g., 18O13C16O). These species have unique physical and chemical properties and could help constrain origins of atmospheric gases and expand the scope of stable isotope geochemistry generally. We present the first measurements of the abundance of 18O13C16O from natural and synthetic sources, discuss the factors influencing its natural distribution and, as an example of its applied use, demonstrate how its abundance constrains the sources of CO2 in the Los Angeles basin. The concentration of 18O13C16O in air can be explained as a combination of ca. 1‰ enrichment (relative to the abundance expected if C and O isotopes are randomly distributed among all possible isotopologues) due to enhanced thermodynamic stability of this isotopologue during isotopic exchange with leaf and surface waters, ca. 0.1‰ depletion due to diffusion through leaf stomata, and subtle (ca. 0.05‰) dilution by 18O13C16O-poor anthropogenic CO2. Some air samples are slightly (ca. 0.05‰) lower in 18O13C16O than can be explained by these factors alone. Our results suggest that 18O 13C16O abundances should vary by up to ca. 0.2‰ with latitude and season, and might have measurable sensitivities to stomatal conductances of land plants. We suggest the greatest use of Δ;47 measurements will be to "leverage" interpretation of the δ18O of atmospheric CO2. Copyright © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we show that dual clumped isotope analyses, i.e., simultaneous ∆47 and ∆48 measurements on the single carbonate phase, can identify the origin and quantify the extent of these kinetic biases. Our results verify theoretical predictions and evidence that the isotopic disequilibrium commonly observed in speleothems and scleractinian coral skeletons is inherited from the dissolved inorganic carbon pool of their parent solutions. Further, we show that dual clumped isotope thermometry can achieve reliable palaeotemperature reconstructions, devoid of kinetic bias.

Such species form the basis of carbonate clumped-isotope thermometry and undergo distinctive fractionations during a variety of natural processes, but initial reports have provided few details of their analysis. In this study, we present detailed data and arguments regarding the theoretical and practical limits of precision, methods of standardization, instrument linearity and related issues for clumped-isotope analysis by dual-inlet gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). We demonstrate long-term stability and subtenth per mil precision in 47/44 ratios for counting systems consisting of a Faraday cup registered through a 1012 Ω resistor on three Thermo-Finnigan 253 IRMS systems. Based on the analyses of heated CO2 gases, which have a stochastic distribution of isotopes among possible isotopologues, we document and correct for (1) isotopic exchange among analyte CO2 molecules and (2) subtle nonlinearity in the relationship between actual and measured 47/44 ratios. External precisions of ∼0.01‰ are routinely achieved for measurements of the mass-47 anomaly (a measure mostly of the abundance anomaly of 13C-18O bonds) and follow counting statistics. The present technical limit to precision intrinsic to our methods and instrumentation is ∼5 parts per million (ppm), whereas precisions of measurements of heterogeneous natural materials are more typically ∼10 ppm (both 1 s.e.).

   abstract = {We describe an approach to estimating the crystallization temperatures of diagenetic calcites using clumped-isotope thermometry, a paleothermometer based on the 13C-18O-bond enrichment in carbonates. Application of this thermometer to calcified gastropod shells and calcite cements in an early Eocene limestone from the Colorado Plateau reveals a record of calcite precipitation and replacement at temperatures varying from 14 to 123°C. The early Eocene host sediments were never deeply buried, but they experienced a significant thermal pulse associated with the emplacement of a late Miocene basalt flow. The combination of independent constraints on thermal history with clumped-isotope thermometry, petrographic (including cathodoluminescence) observations, and oxygen isotopic data provides an improved basis for estimation of the temperature and timing of diagenetic events and fluid sources. The petrography and calcite δ18O values, taken alone, suggest that the aragonite-tocalcite transformation of gastropod shell material occurred simultaneously with early formation of cements and lithification of the matrix in the same sample. However, addition of clumped-isotope thermometry demonstrates that this phase transformation of shell material occurred at temperatures of 94-123°C in a highly rock-buffered microenvironment (i.e., with the isotopic composition of fluid buffered by coexisting carbonate), millions of years after lithification of the matrix and formation of initial low-temperature (14-19°C) calcite cements within shell body cavities. Clumped-isotope temperatures in excess of reasonable Earth-surface conditions recorded by later-formed cements demand that cement growth occurred in association with the lava emplacement. Our results illustrate the potential for clumped-isotope thermometry to constrain conditions of diagenesis and guide interpretations that would not be possible on the basis of conventional stable-isotopic and petrographic data alone, and demonstrate how petrographic characterization of clumped-isotope thermometry samples can benefit paleoclimate studies.

We find pristine carbonatites that have primary oxygen isotope signatures, along with a Carrara marble standard, do not record clumped isotope signatures lighter than 0.31‰ suggesting atoms of carbon and oxygen freely exchange within the carbonate lattice at temperatures above 250-300°C. There is no systematic trend in the clumped isotope signature of pristine carbonatites with age, although partial re-equilibration to lower temperatures can occur if a carbonatite has been exposed to burial temperatures for long periods of time. We conclude that the solid-state re-ordering of carbon and oxygen atoms is sufficiently slow to enable the use of clumped isotope paleothermometry on timescales of 108years, but that diagenetic resetting can still occur, even without bulk recrystallization. In addition to the carbonatite data, an inorganic calibration of the clumped isotope paleothermometer for low temperature carbonates (7.5-77°C) is presented and highlights the need for further inter-lab standardization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Rationale: The measurement of complex isotope systems, notably the multiply substituted isotopologues of CO2 derived from carbonates, is challenging from a mass spectrometric point of view, but it is also time consuming and difficult from a data reduction and normalization perspective. Dedicated software often lags behind and currently limits fast, reliable and reproducible data analysis and inter-laboratory reproducibility. Methods: We have developed new community software ‘Easotope’ using Java and the Eclipse framework. The objectives were to reduce and normalize complex isotopic data easily using a program that could run on multiple platforms, with a central database to store data and constants, an open architecture giving end users a complete view of the data processing steps, and a permissions system allowing the administrator to empower each user in proportion to their expertise. Results: Easotope is now freely available to download, and comprises both a server and a client executable. The server can be run either on a remote machine accessible via the internet, or on a localhost. The client allows users to access the server, and to enter and manipulate data. Easotope currently supports full data storage, data processing and data normalization for bulk isotopes of carbon and oxygen, and for clumped isotopes. Conclusions: Easotope greatly simplifies data processing, reducing processing time to less than a second compared with 30 min when done manually. The software also ensures consistency in data reduction and normalization both within a laboratory and between laboratories. Easotope is designed with the ability to implement other isotopic systems in the future. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE CO2 'clumped-isotope' measurements (tracking enrichment of 16O13C18O, reported as δ47 values, on CO2 derived from carbonate minerals or the atmosphere) are becoming central to a wide range of geochemical investigations. We present a novel approach to address problems with instrument stability, external precision, and the analysis of small samples that have hampered the advancement of δ47 measurements. METHODS We measured δ47 values on CO2 gases introduced via dual inlet to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. We developed a method for determining the 'pressure baseline' and integrating a correction to ion beam intensity measurements during analysis. We then tested this approach for both bellows and micro-volume modes of sample introduction. Heated gas and equilibrated gas lines (δ47 vs. δ47) established the effectiveness of this correction. RESULTS We have determined that drift in instrument calibration that compromises δ47 measurements results from a shift in the baseline signal on sensitive collectors (m/z 47, 48, and 49) that occurs when gas is admitted to the ion source. Applying a 'pressure baseline' (PBL) correction significantly stabilizes δ47 measurements and reduces the dependence of δ47 values on δ47 values by up to an order of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS PBL-corrected heated gas and equilibrated gas calibrations in bellows and micro-volume modes are nearly identical and stable through time. Introduction of the PBL correction, a revision to the absolute reference frame approach to determining δ47 values, dramatically improves the external precision of δ47 measurements to near instrumental analytical uncertainty (6-8 ppm (1σ) in bellows mode; 10-12 ppm in micro-volume mode).

   abstract = {We present a revised approach for standardizing and reporting analyses of multiply substituted isotopologues of CO2 (i.e., 'clumped' isotopic species, especially the mass-47 isotopologues). Our approach standardizes such data to an absolute reference frame based on theoretical predictions of the abundances of multiply-substituted isotopologues in gaseous CO2 at thermodynamic equilibrium. This reference frame is preferred over an inter-laboratory calibration of carbonates because it enables all laboratories measuring mass 47 CO2 to use a common scale that is tied directly to theoretical predictions of clumping in CO2, regardless of the laboratory's primary research field (carbonate thermometry or CO2 biogeochemistry); it explicitly accounts for mass spectrometric artifacts rather than convolving (and potentially confusing) them with chemical fractionations associated with sample preparation; and it is based on a thermodynamic equilibrium that can be experimentally established in any suitably equipped laboratory using commonly available materials. By analyzing CO2 gases that have been subjected to established laboratory procedures known to promote isotopic equilibrium (i.e., heated gases and water-equilibrated CO2), and by reference to thermodynamic predictions of equilibrium isotopic distributions, it is possible to construct an empirical transfer function that is applicable to data with unknown clumped isotope signatures. This transfer function empirically accounts for the fragmentation and recombination reactions that occur in electron impact ionization sources and other mass spectrometric artifacts. We describe the protocol necessary to construct such a reference frame, the method for converting gases with unknown clumped isotope compositions to this reference frame, and suggest a protocol for ensuring that all reported isotopic compositions (e.g., Δ47 values; Eiler and Schauble, 2004; Eiler, 2007) can be compared among different laboratories and instruments, independent of laboratory-specific analytical or methodological differences. We then discuss the use of intra-laboratory secondary reference frames (e.g., based on carbonate standards) that can be more easily used to track the evolution of each laboratory's empirical transfer function. Finally, we show inter-laboratory reproducibility on the order of ±0.010 (1σ) for four carbonate standards, and present revised paleotemperature scales that should be used to convert carbonate clumped isotope signatures to temperature when using the absolute reference frame described here. Even when using the reference frame, small discrepancies remain between two previously published synthetic carbonate calibrations. We discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies, and highlight the need for additional low temperature (<15°C) synthetic carbonate experiments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Clumped isotope measurements aim to quantify some statistical properties of the isotopologue population in a given sample, which requires prior knowledge of the absolute isotopic abundance ratios in reference materials such as VSMOW or VPDB. In the case of CO2, matters are further complicated by the need to define a mass-dependent fractionation law linking the three stable isotopes of oxygen. Conversion from raw mass spectrometric data to mass-47 anomalies (Δ47) thus relies on four external parameters: the (13C/12C) ratio of VPDB, the (17O/16O) and (18O/16O) ratios of VSMOW (or VPDB-CO2), and the slope of the triple oxygen isotope line (λ). Here we investigate the influence that these isotopic parameters exert on measured Δ47 values, using (a) real-world data corresponding to seven months of measurements; (b) simple simulations based on randomly generated data; (c) precise comparisons between water-equilibrated CO2 samples and between carbonate standards believed to share quasi-identical Δ47 values; and (d) reprocessing of two carbonate calibration data sets with different slopes of Δ47 versus T. We demonstrate that the use of different sets of isotopic parameters generally produces systematic offsets as large as 0.04‰ in measured Δ47 values, even after following the established standardization procedures. What's more, even using a single set of isotopic parameters can produce intra- and inter-laboratory discrepancies in measured Δ47 values, if some of these parameters are inaccurate, and depending on the isotopic compositions of the standards used for conversion to the absolute scale of Dennis et al. (2011), these errors should correlate strongly with either δ13C or δ18O, or more weakly with both. Based on measurements of samples expected to display quasi-identical Δ47 values, such as 25 °C water-equilibrated CO2 with different carbon and oxygen isotope compositions, or high-temperature standards ETH-1 and ETH-2, we conclude that the traditional set of isotopic parameters used in all early clumped isotope studies produces large, systematic errors controlled by the relative bulk isotopic compositions of samples and standards. These errors are likely to be one of the key factors responsible for current inter-laboratory discrepancies, but cannot easily explain the conflicting carbonate calibration slopes obtained by different groups. By contrast, the isotopic parameters of Brand et al. (2010) appear to yield accurate Δ47 values regardless of bulk isotopic composition. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations aiming to minimize errors related to the choice of isotopic parameters.},

   abstract = {Measurements of carbon and oxygen Isotopic abundances are commonly based on the mass spectrum of carbon dioxide, but analysis of that spectrum Is not trivial because three Isotope ratios (170/160, 180/160, and 13C/12C) must be determined from only two readily observable Ion-current ratios (45/44 and 46/44). Here, approaches to the problem are reassessed in the light of new information regarding the distribution of oxygen Isotopes in natural samples. It Is shown that methods of calculation conventionally employed can lead to systematic errors in the computed abundance of 13C and that these errors may be related to Incorrect assessment of the absolute abundance of 170. Further, problems arising during the analysis of samples enriched by admixture of 180-labeled materials are discussed, and It Is shown (I) that serious Inaccuracies arise In the computed abundance of 170 and 13C If methods of calculation conventionally employed In the analysis of natural materials are applied to material labeled with 180 but (II) that computed fractional abundances of 180 are always within 0.4 \% of the correct result. Methods for exact calculation of two isotope ratios when the third Is known are presented and discussed, and a more exact approach to the computation of all three Isotope ratios In natural materials Is given. Measurement of the mass spectrum of a molecule can quantify only the relative abundances of molecular species of differing mass. Elemental isotope ratios are not measurable directly and must be determined by calculations based on the observed molecular spectrum (1). In the case of carbon dioxide , for example, ion currents appear at m/z 44 through m/z 49. With the exception of m/z 44 (12C1602), all measurable ion currents represent sums of multiple isotopic contributions (e.g., 13C170160 + 12C180160 + 12C1702 at m/z 46). A problem common to all mathematical formulations (2-4) is that a measurement of two ion-current ratios ([45]/[44] and [46]/[44]) does not provide sufficient information to obtain unique solutions for three isotope ratios (13C/12C, 170/160, and 180/160). The oxygen-isotope ratios have, therefore, commonly been treated as functionally related; that is, an expression for 170/160 as a function of 180/160 has been employed as the third equation required for solution of the problem. This approach is based on the fact that processes (other than ad-mixture of separated isotopes) which have affected the abundance of 180 must also have affected the abundance of 170, and vice versa (5). Recently, however, it has been shown (i) that no single, fixed relationship correctly describes the fractionation of 170 relative to 180 in all processes and (ii) that the relationship commonly employed by isotopic mass spec-trometrists does not correctly describe even the "average relationship" prevailing in natural systems (6). Here, we explore the significance of these findings for isotopic analysis and show that a simple system of equations for accurate calculation of isotopic abundances can be developed.

We will consistently employ the letter R to designate the ratio of a particular isotopic species to the related isotopic species of lowest mass isotopic species of mass n nR =- .-(1) base species related to n Left superscripts will be used to designate isotopic species by mass. For = 13, the base species is 12C; for = 17 or 18, 160; and, for 45 < < 49, the base species is 12C1602.

Mass Spectrum of Carbon Dioxide. Since the vibrational modes in C02 are nearly harmonic and coupling between modes is weak (7), the distribution of isotopes among molecules at equilibrium is accurately described by a simple probability function (1). The abundances of the various molecular species are, therefore, related to the isotopic abundances by the following equations: 44p = 12 .1ß .1ß In practice, it is most convenient to express these relationships in terms of ratios.

   abstract = {The abundance of the doubly substituted CO2 isotopologue, 13C18O16O, in CO2 produced by phosphoric acid digestion of synthetic, inorganic calcite and natural, biogenic aragonite is proportional to the concentration of 13C-18O bonds in reactant carbonate, and the concentration of these bonds is a function of the temperature of carbonate growth. This proportionality can be described between 1 and 50 °C by the function: Δ47 = 0.0592 · 106 · T-2 -0.02, where Δ47 is the enrichment, in per mil, of 13C18 O16O in CO2 relative to the amount expected for a stochastic (random) distribution of isotopes among all CO2 isotopologues, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. This relationship can be used for a new kind of carbonate paleothermometry, where the temperature-dependent property of interest is the state of ordering of 13C and 18O in the carbonate lattice (i.e., bound together vs. separated into different CO32- units), and not the bulk δ18O or δ13C values. Current analytical methods limit precision of this thermometer to ca. ± 2 °C, 1σ. A key feature of this thermometer is that it is thermodynamically based, like the traditional carbonate-water paleothermometer, and so is suitable for interpolation and even modest extrapolation, yet is rigorously independent of the δ18 O of water and δ13C of DIC from which carbonate grew. Thus, this technique can be applied to parts of the geological record where the stable isotope compositions of waters are unknown. Moreover, simultaneous determinations of Δ47 and δ18O for carbonates will constrain the δ18O of water from which they grew. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we show that the 253 Plus™ gas source mass spectrometer equipped with Faraday cups and 1013 Ω resistors can perform combined ∆47 and ∆48 analyses on carbonates with external reproducibilities (1SD) of 0.010 ‰ and 0.030 ‰, respectively. ~10 mg aliquots of five carbonate reference materials (ETH 1, ETH 2, ETH 3, ETH 4, and Carrara) are digested with phosphoric acid at 90 °C using a common acid bath. The evolved CO2 is purified using an automated gas preparation system (including cryotraps and a GC) and analyzed for its ∆47 and ∆48 compositions using the dual inlet system of a 253 Plus™ gas source mass spectrometer. Raw ∆47 and ∆48 values are finally normalized to the Carbon Dioxide Equilibrium Scale (CDES). In ∆47, CDES 90°C vs. ∆48, CDES 90°C space, calcite reference materials Carrara, ETH 3 and ETH 4 agree with the equilibrium curve for calcite after adding semi-empirically determined 90 °C acid fractionation factors of 0.196 ‰ (for ∆47) and 0.136 ‰ (for ∆48) to theoretical ∆63 and ∆64 data. Agreement between measured and theoretically expected ∆48, CDES 90°C highlights the accuracy of our high-precision clumped isotope analytical setup. Combined analysis of the abundances of mass 47 and mass 48 isotopologues in CO2 evolved from acid digestion of natural carbonates has excellent potential for the determination of accurate and highly precise paleotemperatures as well as for the identification of rate-limiting kinetic processes involved in biomineralization.

   abstract = {Isotopologues of molecular gases containing more than one rare isotope (multiply substituted isotopologues) can be analyzed with high precision (1σ <0.1‰), despite their low natural abundances (∼ ppm to ppt in air), and can constrain geochemical budgets of natural systems. We derive a method for calculating abundances of all such species in a thermodynamically equilibrated population of isotopologues, and present results of these calculations for O2, CO, N2, NO, CO2, and N2O between 1000 and 193 to 77 K. In most cases, multiply substituted isotopologues are predicted to be enriched relative to stochastic (random) distributions by ca. 1 to 2‰ at earth-surface temperatures. This deviation, defined as Δi for isotopologue i, generally increases linearly with 1/T at temperatures ≤ 500 K. An exception is N2O, which shows complex temperature dependences and 10's of per-mill enrichments or depletions of abundances for some isotopologues. These calculations provide a basis for discriminating between fractionations controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics and other sorts of isotopic fractionations in the budgets of atmospheric gases. Moreover, because abundances of multiply substituted isotopologues in thermodynamically equilibrated populations of molecules vary systematically with temperature, they can be used as geothermometers. Such thermometers are unusual in that they involve homogeneous rather than heterogeneous equilibria (e.g., isotopic distribution in gaseous CO2 alone, rather than difference in isotopic composition between CO2 and coexisting water). Also, multiple independent thermometers exist for all molecules having more than one multiply substituted isotopologue (e.g., thermometers based on abundances of 18O13C16O and 18O12C18O are independent); thus, temperatures estimated by this method can be tested for internal consistency.

   abstract = {The stable (δ18O and δ13C) and clumped (Δ47) isotope compositions of coral carbonate are valuable archives for paleoclimate reconstructions. However, the Δ47-temperature relationships of warm and cold-water corals deviate from that of inorganic carbonate precipitated at equilibrium. Dual clumped isotope thermometry of carbonates (i.e., simultaneous Δ47 and Δ48 measurements on a single carbonate) has the potential to achieve more accurate paleotemperature reconstruction, identifying and correcting for kinetically driven isotopic disequilibrium. Here we present the first extensive dual clumped isotope dataset of coral carbonate, spanning a broad range of cold and warm-water coral species. We confirm that corals are enriched in Δ47 and depleted in Δ48 relative to equilibrium, a pattern corresponding to the mixing of an equilibrium DIC pool with kinetically derived HCO3– produced by hydration and hydroxylation of CO2. Dual clumped isotope measurements of cold-water corals fall on the initial linear portion of model (IsoDIC) predicted departure from equilibrium. The dual clumped isotope composition of cold-water corals, corrected by the model-predicted Δ47/Δ48 offset slope (−0.78), yield accurate reconstruction of coral growth temperature with a precision of <3 °C at the 68% confidence level. In contrast, disequilibrium offsets in the Δ47 and Δ48 of warm-water corals correspond to precipitation from a more equilibrated DIC pool, which we attribute to the action of carbonic anhydrase in the calcifying fluid. It may be possible to correct warm-water coral growth temperatures, using an empirically derived correction (Δ47/ Δ48 offset slope of −0.4). Dual clumped isotope thermometry of coral carbonate opens new possibilities to reconstruct both sea surface temperatures and ocean dynamics of intermediate to deep water masses.},

   abstract = {The stable oxygen and clumped isotope composition of brachiopod calcite are important proxies for the reconstruction of Phanerozoic seawater temperatures and δ18O values. The utility of brachiopods as a temperature archive is nonetheless challenged by indications that their shells precipitate out of isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater, though the origin of disequilibrium effects has remained elusive. Here, we apply the recently developed dual clumped isotope thermometer (i.e., the simultaneous measurement of Δ47 and Δ48 values in CO2 derived from the acid digestion of carbonates) to modern and fossil brachiopods to investigate disequilibrium signatures recorded in brachiopod calcite. We present evidence that disequilibrium signatures are derived from the combination of two rate-limiting processes: the hydration/hydroxylation of CO2, and, potentially, the diffusion of HCO3−/CO32− in water. An empirical correction for clumped isotope disequilibrium is presented, based on correlation between measured disequilibrium offsets in the Δ47 and Δ48 values of modern brachiopods (Δ47disequilibrium = –0.88 × Δ48disequilibrium + 0.02). Dual clumped isotope thermometry of Eocene age brachiopods from Seymour Island (∼65 °S) yields temperatures in agreement with previously reported Δ47 derived temperatures from coeval bivalves. In contrast, uncorrected Δ47 derived temperatures from the same brachiopods are 6–11 °C colder. Measurement of dual clumped isotope composition alongside δ18O values of brachiopod carbonate should also enable more accurate reconstruction of seawater-δ18O. In comparison with group-specific Δ47-temperature calibrations, which correct for an average kinetic bias in Δ47, dual clumped isotope thermometry accounts for the magnitude of disequilibrium inherent to an individual sample, facilitating more reliable paleotemperature and seawater-δ18O reconstructions.},

   abstract = {Accurate reconstruction of seasonal atmospheric patterns of the past is essential for reliable prediction of how climate will evolve due to anthropogenic CO2 forcing. The Eocene ‘hot house’ climate, as the warmest epoch during the Cenozoic, is considered as a potential analogue for ‘high-CO2’ future climate scenarios. In this context, the reconstruction of variations in seasonality are as important as changes in mean annual conditions. Here we combine stable oxygen (δ18O) and dual clumped isotope (Δ47 + Δ48) measurements of a bivalve shell to determine sub-annual variations in sea surface temperatures and oceanic freshening in the Paris Basin during the Mid-Eocene Climate Optimum, 40 million years ago. Our reconstruction indicates to high mean annual temperatures with a small seasonal amplitude (33.3 °C ± 4.4 °C) and an enhanced fresh water input during the summer period. Our results implying a substantially warmer climate state with different hydrological conditions for Western Europe during the Eocene than previously suggested by proxy data or climate modelling.},

   abstract = {Methane-derived authigenic carbonate often constitutes the sole remaining record of relic methane seeps. The clumped (∆ 47) and oxygen isotopic composition of seep carbonates often yield inaccurate temperatures, attributed to kinetic isotope effects and modification of seawater isotope composition by hydrate water. Here, we analyzed the dual-clumped isotope (∆ 47 /∆ 48) composition of authigenic carbonate from a modern methane seep. We demonstrate that aragonite forms closest to isotopic equilibrium such that its ∆ 47 can directly yield the correct forma-tional temperature, whereas calcite is unambiguously biased by kinetic isotope effects. Numerical models show that the observed bias in the isotopic composition arises from rate-limiting dehydration/dehydroxylation of HCO 3 − alongside diffusive fractionation, which can be corrected for with analysis of carbonate ∆ 47 /∆ 48 values. We demonstrate the utility of dual-clumped isotope analysis for studying seep carbonates, as it reveals the origin and magnitude of kinetic biases and can be used to reconstruct paleotemperature and seawater δ 18 O.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Information on the temperature of formation or alteration of carbonate minerals can be obtained by measuring the abundance of the isotopologues 47 and 48 (Δ47 and Δ48 values) of CO2 released during acid dissolution. The combination of these two proxies can potentially provide a greater insight into the temperature of formation, particularly if the carbonate minerals form by non-equilibrium processes. Methods: We have precipitated calcium carbonates at seven temperatures between 5 and 65°C and measured their δ48 values using a Thermo-253 plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The values were transformed to Δ48 values in the conventional manner and then converted to the carbon dioxide equilibrium scale. Results: Using the Δ48 values, we have established an empirical calibration between temperature and Δ48 values: (Formula presented.) Conclusions: The calibration line produced allows the determination of the temperature of natural carbonates using the Δ48 values and agrees with the measurements of the Δ47 and Δ48 values of some carbonates assumed to have formed under equilibrium conditions.},
